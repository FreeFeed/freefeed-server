# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- The main homefeed hide list is now applied to posts authored by friends (in
  _friends-all-activity_ mode). It affects the following situation: you are
  subscribed to the user U in main homefeed and to the group G in secondary
  homefeed, and U created a post in G. Now you will not see this post in main
  homefeed in _friends-all-activity_ mode.
