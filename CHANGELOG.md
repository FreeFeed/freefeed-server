## [1.87.0] - 2020-10-13
### Added
 - The Server-Timing response header (for now, it contains a single metric,
   'total' - the total request processing time)

### Fixed
 - In the real-time message about the groups' update, the listener's
   subscription to the groups additionally checked. Without this check, the user
   could see groups he isn't subscribed to in the recent groups' list.

## [1.86.0] - 2020-09-15

### Added
- Improve search: search by exact word form, by prefix and with word order
  operator

## [1.85.0] - 2020-09-01

### Fixed

- Groups in realtime events (such as `user:update` or `global:user:update`) now
  serializes according to the current user. This affects the visibility of the
  group's administrators list.
- Respect privacy-settings given during account creation

### Changed
- The main homefeed hide list is now applied to posts authored by friends (in
  _friends-all-activity_ mode). It affects the following situation: you are
  subscribed to the user U in main homefeed and to the group G in secondary
  homefeed, and U created a post in G. Now you will not see this post in main
  homefeed in _friends-all-activity_ mode.
