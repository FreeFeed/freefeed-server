Your session has been blocked due to suspicious activity
--------------------------------------------------------

One of your authorization sessions has been blocked due to suspicious
activity. The session was accessed from:

  IP: <%= access.ip %>
  Time: <%= access.date.toDateString() %>
  Browser: <%= access.userAgent %>

The last usage of this session was from:

  IP: <%= session.lastIP || 'undefined' %>
  Time: <%= session.lastUsedAt?.toDateString() || 'undefined' %>
  Browser: <%= session.lastUserAgent || 'undefined' %>

If you don't recognize any of these IP addresses or browsers, we recommend you
to review your authorization sessions list and change the <%= config.siteTitle %>
password (see <%= config.mailer.host %>/settings/sign-in).

<%= config.siteTitle %> Team
