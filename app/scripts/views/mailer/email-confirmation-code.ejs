Email confirmation code
-----------------------

Your email address (<%= email %>) confirmation code is as follows:

  <%= code %>

Copy this code to the <%= config.siteTitle %> form that requires it.

If you didn't request an email address confirmation, just ignore this email.
<% if (someAccountsExists) { %>
WARNING: You are signing up for a user account on <%=config.siteTitle %> with an email address
that has been previously used to register one or more user accounts.

Registering multiple accounts with the same email is not possible. Please choose a different
email address.
<%_ } -%>
<% if (otherAccount) { %>
WARNING: We already have a @<%=otherAccount.username%> account with this email address.
You will need to provide a different address to successfully change your account email. 
<%_ } -%>

If you forgot your password you can reset it here: <%= config.mailer.host %>/restore

<%= config.siteTitle %> Team
