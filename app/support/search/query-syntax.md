# Search query syntax

The search query is a sequence of text terms and search operators.

You can put the minus sign (`-`) right before the text term or operator to _exclude_ it from search results: `cat -mouse` will return documents with the "cat" word but without the "mouse" word.

## Search scopes

The search is performed across post and comment texts, titles and digests of published articles, as well as usernames, screennames, and descriptions of users and groups. By default, the search covers all these texts, but the search scope can be narrowed using scope operators.

An article is searched as part of its linked post. The search result is the post, and the post's visibility rules apply.

Full syntax is available in all search scopes except usernames (logins). Username search is limited: morphology is not used, _substrings_ of the login are searched, and only the _and_, _or_, and _not_ operators can be used (others are ignored). For example, the username `badapple` will be found by queries `bad`, `apple`, `apple bad`, or `apple | pear -good`.

## Text terms

The text term is a word without white spaces (like `cat`, or `#mouse` or even `http://freefeed.net/`) or a double-quoted string that can include spaces: `"cat mouse"`. Putting text in double quotes tells the search engine to search these words in the specific order and in exact word forms. It is also possible to search words by prefix (not in double quotes): `cat*`.

By default _all_ text terms in query will be searched (AND is implied). You can use the "pipe" symbol (`|`) to search _any_ of them: `cat | mouse` will find documents with "cat" OR with "mouse". To search words in the specific order use the "plus" symbol (`+`): `cat + mouse` means these two words standing next to each other in that order.

Two important rules about the `+` and `|` symbols:

1. The `|` symbol has the highest priority: `cat mouse | dog` means 'the documents with "cat" AND ("mouse" OR "dog")'; `cat + mouse | dog` means 'the documents with "cat" FOLLOWED_BY ("mouse" OR "dog")'.
2. The AND symbol has the lowest priority: `cat + mouse dog` means 'the documents with ("cat" FOLLOWED_BY "mouse") AND "dog"'.
3. You can use the `|` and `+` symbols only between the text terms, not with the other operators.

## Operators

General rule: in any operator you can omit dash symbol (if present) and the 's suffix of the plural word form. For example the `in-comments:` operator can also be written as `incomments:` or `incomment:`.

Some operators take a user name as an argument. In such operators you can use a special user name, `me` that means you, the current signed in user. The `cat from:me` query will find the "cat" word in all posts and comments of the current user.

### Global search scope

⚠ Warning: you can not use minus modifier with global search scope operators.

By default, the search is performed in post and comment bodies and in titles and digests of linked articles. The following operators change this behavior.

**in-body:** — starting from this operator the search will be performed only in post bodies.

Example: `cat in-body: mouse` — the "cat" will be searched in posts, comments, and linked articles, but the "mouse" will be searched only in post bodies. Note that there's a space after a colon because "in-body:" is a separate operator here.

**in-comments:** — starting from this operator the search will be performed only in the comment bodies.

Example: `in-comments: mouse` — the "mouse" will be searched only in comment bodies.

**in-users:** / **in-accounts:** — starting from this operator the search will be performed only in the usernames, screennames and descriptions of users and groups.

Example: `in-users: mouse` — the "mouse" will be searched only in user names, screennames and descriptions.

The global search scope operators switch the search scope from themselves to the end of the query or to another global scope operator. 

### Interval operators

Some operators allow to specify the interval of the values. The interval syntax is common for all such operators, see the `comments:` syntax below.
* `comments:N` means exactly N comments
* `comments:=N` is the same as `comments:N`
* `comments:<N` means less than N comments
* `comments:>N` means more than N comments
* `comments:<=N` means less than or equal to N comments
* `comments:>=N` means more than or equal to N comments
* `comments:N1..N2` means at least N1 and at most N2 comments
* `comments:N1..*` is the same as `comments:>=N1`
* `comments:*..N2` is the same as `comments:<=N2`

### Local search scope

Local search scope operators are like global ones but without switching the global search scope.

**in-body:word1,word2** or **in-body:"quoted text"** will search _any_ of word1, word2 or the "quoted text" in post bodies but will not change the global query scope. Note that there is no space after a colon.

**in-comments:word1,word2** or **in-comments:"quoted text"** does the same for comments.

Example: `cat in-body:mouse dog` — the "cat" and "dog" will be searched in posts, comments, and linked articles, but the "mouse" will be searched only in post bodies.

### Content filtering

**from:user1,user2** limits search to posts authored by user1 or user2. The `from:alice cat` query will search "cat" in posts authored by Alice _and in any of their comments_ (not only in Alice's comments).

**in:user1,group2** limits search to posts published in user1 or group2 feeds.

`cat in:cats` will find all posts with the "cat" word in the @cats group.

`cat in:cats from:alice` will find all posts with the "cat" word authored by Alice in the @cats group.

`cat in:cats,alice` will find all posts with the "cat" word posted to Alice's own feed OR to the @cats group.

`cat in:cats in:alice` will find all posts with the "cat" word posted to Alice's own feed AND to the @cats group.

The "in:" operator has the "group:" alias, which is left for compatibility.

**in-my:feed1,feed2** limits search to the current user's personal feeds. The personal feed names are: "saves", "directs", "discussions" and "friends". You can omit the 's suffix in these names. The "friends" feed means all feeds of users and groups the current user is subscribed to.

`cat in-my:saves` will find all posts with the "cat" word in my Saves feed.

**commented-by:user1,user2** limits search to posts commented by user1 or user2.

`cat commented-by:alice` will find all posts with the "cat" word (in body or in any comments) among the posts commented by Alice.

**liked-by:user1,user2** limits search to posts liked by user1 or user2.

`cat liked-by:alice` will find all posts liked by Alice with the "cat" word.

**to:user1,group2** limits search to posts published in group2 feed or written _to_ user1 as a direct message. This operator acts like **in:** for the groups but also allows to search in direct messages with the specific addressee.

**cliked-by:user1,user2** limits search to comments liked by user1 or user2.

`cat cliked-by:alice` will find all comments liked by Alice with the "cat" word.

Since `cliked-by:` makes sense only for comments, it switches the search scope to comments. So the query `cat cliked-by:alice` is equal to `in-comments: cat cliked-by:alice`. Being used in post body scope (like `in-body: cliked-by:...`), `cliked-by:` is ignored.

**is:private,protected** limits search to posts with the specified visibility. These are `private`, `protected` and `public`.

**has:images,audio** limits search to posts with attached content of the specified type. It has a **with:** alias. You can specify a concrete file type (`images`, `audio` or `video`), search for any files using `has:files`, or search for posts with a linked article using `has:article`. You can also specify a file extension; for example, `has:mp3` searches for files with the `mp3` extension.

**comments:*(interval)*** limits search to posts with the specified number of comments.

**likes:*(interval)*** limits search to posts with the specified number of likes.

**clikes:*(interval))*** limits search to comments with the specified number of likes.

Since `clikes:` makes sense only for comments, it switches the search scope to comments. So the query `cat clikes:1` is equal to `in-comments: cat clikes:1`. Being used in post body scope (like `in-body: clikes:...`), `clikes:` is ignored.

**date:*(interval)*** and **post-date:*(interval)*** limits search to content published on the specified date. 

Dates should be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY-MM` or just `YYYY`. A date with a year only matches any time in that year. A date with a month and year matches any time in that month and year. A date with a day, month, and year matches any time at that specific date.

The `date:` operator defines the date of the content being searched. The `foo date:2020-01-01` will search the "foo" word in posts published on 2020-01-01 or in comments published on 2020-01-01 (even if the post date is different).

The `post-date:` always sets the post date. The `in-comments: foo post-date:2020-01-01` will search the "foo" word in comments to posts published on 2020-01-01.

### Content authorship

**author:user1,user2** performs search only in content from user1 or user2. It has a **by:** alias.

The "content" is defined by the current search scope. By default it includes post and comment bodies and titles and digests of linked articles: `cat author:alice` will search the "cat" word in all such content authored by Alice.

`in-body: author:alice cat` will search the "cat" word only in Alice's post bodies. In this context, 'author:' works in the same way as 'from:'.

`in-comments: author:alice cat` will search the "cat" word only in Alice's comments bodies.
