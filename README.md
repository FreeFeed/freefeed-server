FreeFeed Server
===============

FreeFeed is a social network that enables you to discover and discuss the interesting
stuff your friends find on the web.

FreeFeed is being built as a replacement for FriendFeed, the real-time aggregator and social network
where "likes" for user generated content were implemented for the first time.

FreeFeed is based on [Pepyatka](https://github.com/pepyatka/pepyatka-server/) project
